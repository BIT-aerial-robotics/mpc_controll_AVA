# mpc_controll_AVA
This code is the MPC controller of the Aerial Vehicles Assembly(AVA) platform. It is a ROS node and can run on the ubuntu18.04/ROS Melodic system.The function of this node is to keep the hover of the AVA platform.

As shown in the figure, if the node get_master_make_m publishes data 1 to /mode_switch, run the mpc_controller node, otherwise run the controller node. The control node is a traditional control algorithm. In actual flight, the controller is run first to keep the drone hovering, and then it is switched to the mpc controller to run. The output of the controller node and the mpc_controller node are the same, both are the attitude and pulling force of the three-shelf aircraft. The plant node is the dynamic simulation model of the AVA platform.
